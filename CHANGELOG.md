- Cleanup + optimizations

- Renamed `Server` to `Client`, and the former `ServerRepository` file `servers.json` to `clients.json`, just rename it...

- Replaced the global whisper with a global chat, its more useful tbh...

- `JavelinServer` and `JavelinClient` instances are guaranteed to be created on startup.

- Added the ability to reconnect the client.

- Improved documentation
